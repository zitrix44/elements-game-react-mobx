# discovered (runtime data)							
# - used for save/load the game 							
# - leave blank while you define rules							
# - root elements will be opened automatically							
"# - TODO: if you want to open the element automatically: set to ""+"" (remove quotes)"							
"# - TODO: if you want to mark element as opened by player/user: set to JS date as number (no quotes for numbers); e.g. ""946684800000"" for Date.UTC(2000, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0), ""946684801000"" for Date.UTC(2000, 11, 31, 0, 0, 0, 0), ""978220800000"" "
